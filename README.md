What insights are possible?

Several pre-defined high-level dashboard samples are included:
- **1. Leads Capture & Conversion** - Understand leads generated from marketing activities, current status, and how quickly sales are converting to opportunities.
- **2. Opportunity Trends & Pipeline** - Identify open opportunities and their current stage, which are likely to close and how well sales teams are converting to wins.
- **3. Sales Activities & Engagement** - Highlight leads and opportunities which need immediate follow up and understand overall engagement trends across sales.
- **4. Case Overview & Trends** - Understand overall customer service position across all open cases and case trends.
- **5. Case Management & Resolution** - Get a pulse check on how efficient the service team is at case resolution and highlight any long running open cases for prioritization.
- **6. Accounts with Cases** - Identify which accounts have open cases and which need immediate focus.

These 6 dashboards are accompanied by 5 supplemental detail dashboards with pertinent drill information. The dashboards have been organized by relationship to one of the 6 primary dashboards.
(For example, dashboards related to "1. Leads Capture & Conversion" will have titles following this pattern "1_a" "1_b").
